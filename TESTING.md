## Bugs


- Django `ValueError` at /adotpions/adopt

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug01.png)

    - To fix this, I added char fields to the adoption model.

- Django `ValueError api key` at /guineapig/add

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug02.png)

    - To fix this, I updated the cloudinary version.


- Django `DataError` at /adopt

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug03.png)

    - To fix this, I added positive integer field validators to the Adoption model living arrangements.
