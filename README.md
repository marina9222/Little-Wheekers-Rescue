## UX


### Colour Scheme

- `#FBA80C` used for website background color.
- `#636B2F` used for primary color.
- `#323232` used for primary text color.
- `#FAFAFA` used primary highlights.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/coolors.png)

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    
    --primary-text-color:#323232;
    --primary-color: #636B2F;
    --primary-bg-color: #FAFAFA;
}
```

### Typography

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as sign up and log in forms and in the footer.
