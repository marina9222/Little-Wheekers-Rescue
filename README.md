## UX


### Colour Scheme

- `#FBA80C` used for website background color.
- `#636B2F` used for primary color.
- `#323232` used for primary text color.
- `#FAFAFA` used primary highlights.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/coolors.png)

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    
    --primary-text-color:#323232;
    --primary-color: #636B2F;
    --primary-bg-color: #FAFAFA;
}
```

### Typography

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as sign up and log in forms and in the footer.

## Database Design

I have used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:
- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```
- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- dragged the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.


## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://little-wheekers-rescue-bfdb249eed00.herokuapp.com).


### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.


### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase-order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
- From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
	- `https://little-wheekers-rescue-bfdb249eed00.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
- Click **receive all events**.
- Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
- You'll have a new key here:
	- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Wehbook) Key (starts with **wh**)

### Gmail API

This project uses [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) to handle sending emails to users for account verification and purchase order confirmations.

Once you've created a Gmail (Google) account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- Click on the **Account Settings** (cog icon) in the top-right corner of Gmail.
- Click on the **Accounts and Import** tab.
- Within the section called "Change account settings", click on the link for **Other Google Account settings**.
- From this new page, select **Security** on the left.
- Select **2-Step Verification** to turn it on. (verify your password and account)
- Once verified, select **Turn On** for 2FA.
- Navigate back to the **Security** page, and you'll see a new option called **App passwords**.
- This might prompt you once again to confirm your password and account.
- Select **Mail** for the app type.
- Select **Other (Custom name)** for the device type.
	- Any custom name, such as "Django" or Little-Wheekers-Rescue
- You'll be provided with a 16-character password (API key).
	- Save this somewhere locally, as you cannot access this key again later!
	- `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
	- `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user's own value |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | user's own value |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | user's own value |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | user's own value |


Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.19`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_API_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `âŒ˜+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*
